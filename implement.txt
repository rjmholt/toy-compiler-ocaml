code cleanup:
    * Move Oz code printing into a new file away from IR generation

symbol table:
    * Implement lvalue type lookups to deal with fields in struct types
    * Move this implementation into the code generation part
    * Do a first scan to read proc headers so that proc definition order
      doesn't matter

code generation:
    * Fix pass by reference -- currently there is a bug in it
    * Integrate field/structs from the symbol table once that's done
