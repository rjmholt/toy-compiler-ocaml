TODOs

Do semantic checking as an interface/service

Clean up code

So TODO:
  	- Check for repeated fields in rstructs
  	- Improve type checking for compound lvals in expressions (so that they don't throw funny errors when you try to use them like scalars)
  	- Replace all the nasty internal error messages with helpful ones that don't reveal the compiler's internal failings and miserable existence
  	- Comment everything
	- Names and student numbers at the top of every file
