not (true or false)  -->   not true or false
(Currently prints as "not (true or false)")
	Leon: I think this keeping brackets is correct. "not" binds 
	tigher than "or" thus removing brackets will change the meaning 
	of "not (true or false)"

proc f(, val int x)
is a valid proc header. Need to fix the parser

Fix the proc grammar so that proc body is separate. Then
we can hopefully remove the shift-reduce error in stmts decls.
This will require changing the AST

Running programm without -p does not print error message "Sorry, 
cannot generate code yet"

Giving arguments in main does not error

If a program does not contain main it does not error

should_remove := 3 * (3 * 3); but does not. (It should remove this 
right?)

should_remove := 3 + (3 + 3); but does not

should_keep := (5 < 3) < k; but does not. (Is this too hard 
for parser?)
